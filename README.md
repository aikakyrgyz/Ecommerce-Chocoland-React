=====================General Layout of the Pages=====================

---------------------------Home Page-----------------------------


---------------------------About Page-----------------------------


---------------------------Flavor Page-----------------------------


---------------------------Brand Page-----------------------------


---------------------------OrderForm Page-----------------------------


=====================Requirements Specification=====================

1.An overview of your business, the products you sell, the management team, and any other information that you think makes sense for the customers to know about your company. 




2.Display a list of products (at least 10) available for sale in a table with multiple rows and columns, where each product is shown within a separate cell.


3.Display an image for each product available for sale in each cell.



4.Display the price and other key information (e.g., color, material, etc.) associated with each product in the corresponding table cell.



5.The user should be able to choose a product from this table by clicking on the corresponding image, which should lead to a new page that provides additional details about the product, e.g., more images, detailed description, etc. 



6.On the detailed description page, the user should be able to order a product by filling a form. The form should allow the user to enter the product identifier, quantity, first name, last name, phone number, shipping address, shipping method (e.g., overnight, 2-days expedited, 6-days ground), credit card information, and anything else that you think makes sense for your business.



7.Upon submitting the form, the website should send an email with the purchase order information included in the body of the email. Note that to send an email, one needs to connect to the SMTP server, which is not possible with the client-side software. Thus, this requirement simply requires bringing up the email client with the purchase order information included in the body of the email and allowing the user to send the email. 



8.Before submitting the form, it should be checked for proper formatting, including whether all fields are filled properly, whether the phone number, address, and credit card are properly formatted, etc. An alarm should be raised if a field is empty or not properly formatted to prevent submission of bad data. 



9.Your website should use CSS for layout and styling. You should create style rules so that the general design of the website, mainly the products page, is as close as possible to this image:



10.The website should be responsive and mobile friendly.



11.Provide the ability to to track the mouse movement, such that when the mouse moves over a product image, the size of the image is increased, and when the mouse moves out, the size of the image is returned back to normal. This feature can be implemented on either the page that displays the various products, or on the pages that show the details of each product, or both.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
